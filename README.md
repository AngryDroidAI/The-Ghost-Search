The Ghost Search - Proxy IP Generator Presentation provides an in-depth overview of the Ghost Search tool and introduces a new feature called the Proxy IP Generator. The presentation begins with a welcoming message, highlighting Ghost Search as the ultimate tool for anonymous browsing. It then delves into the proxy configuration options, including type, address, port, username, and password.
The presentation showcases the search functionality of Ghost Search, allowing users to enter search queries and redirecting them to DuckDuckGo with resolved IP addresses. It also demonstrates the country selection dropdown, enabling users to filter proxies by country for better customization.
The heart of the presentation is the Proxy List, which displays a comprehensive table of proxy information, including protocol, IP address, port, country, anonymity, HTTPS support, latency, and last checked timestamp.
A new feature introduced in the presentation is the IP Generator button, which randomly generates IP addresses and adds them to the proxy list table, enhancing proxy management capabilities.
The DNS resolution process in Ghost Search involves translating domain names (e.g., duckduckgo.com) into IP addresses using selected DNS servers. This ensures that users can access websites securely and anonymously through proxies.
Ghost Search offers a variety of DNS servers for users to choose from, each with its own set of IP addresses for DNS resolution. These servers include well-known options like Google DNS, Quad9, Cloudflare, and others, providing users with flexibility and options based on their preferences.
By selecting a DNS server from the provided list, users can control how their DNS queries are resolved, enhancing privacy and security while browsing the web. This feature empowers users to customize their browsing experience according to their needs and preferences.
